                Interested in kids, creativity, and online communities?
                We&#39;re seeking community moderators to work with the Scratch
                Team. Moderators will support creative activities and
                positive interactions on Scratch â€” a free online community
                where young people program and share interactive stories,
                games, and animations. Scratch has grown to more than 20
                million registered members (ages 8 and up), creating and
                sharing thousands of projects each day. Moderators will
                gain valuable experience working online with youth in a
                creative, interest driven setting.
