# Requirements

* Selenium
  * See this directory's package.json
* TAP
  * In the scratch-www repo's package.json
* [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)

# Running the tests

* By default, tests run against our Staging instance, but you can pass in a different location if you want to run the tests against e.g. your local build

## Using tap
* Run all tests in the smoke-testing directory from the command-line: `$ SMOKE_USERNAME=username SMOKE_PASSWORD=password ROOT_URL=https://scratch.mit.edu make smoke`
* To run a single file from the command-line: `$ SMOKE_USERNAME=username SMOKE_PASSWORD=password ROOT_URL=https://scratch.mit.edu node_modules/.bin/tap ./test/integration/smoke-testing/filename.js --timeout=3600`
  * The timeout var is for the length of the entire tap test-suite; if you are getting a timeout error, you may need to adjust this value (some of the Selenium tests take a while to run)
